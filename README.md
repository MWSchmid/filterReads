filterReads
===========

I am currently working on a program that filters short reads using a set of defined sequences which shall be ignored (the motivation behind this was the observation that some RNA-Seq samples have an obscene number of reads aligning to ribosomal DNA).

Linux 64 bit binaries and source code will be available soon (somewhen in November 2014).
